## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-25

### Added

- `before all` / `after all` hooks for suite-level setup and teardown (run once per file)
- `kill the app` command — force-stop without relaunch (CLI-side via ADB/simctl)
- `open the app` now performs CLI-side launch + reconnect when device context is available
- `copy "text" to clipboard` and `paste from clipboard` commands (agent-side via Dart Clipboard API)
- `set location lat, lng` command — set device GPS coordinates (ADB geo fix / simctl location)
- `verify external browser opened` command — checks url_launcher platform channel for external launches
- `call GET/POST/PUT/DELETE "url"` command — execute real HTTP requests from tests (Go-side net/http)
- `call ... with body "json"` — HTTP calls with request body, response stored in `<response.status>` and `<response.body>` variables
- `<random.email>`, `<random.name>`, `<random.phone>`, `<random.uuid>`, `<random.number(min,max)>`, `<random.text(length)>` data generators for form-heavy tests
- `with examples from "file.csv"` — load data-driven test data from external CSV files
- Unit tests for random data generators, CSV loader, all new parser commands
- E2E test files for all new features: hooks, clipboard, app lifecycle, location, random data, HTTP calls, CSV-driven tests
